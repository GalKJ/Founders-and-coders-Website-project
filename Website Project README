# Founders-and-coders-Website-project

## Introduction section

I wanted to chop the website into distinct sections and decided to do that using a `min-width: 100vh;`. This way I would be able to keep the first section of the page clear and easy to read whilst allowing the second section to be more interactive and experimental.

I used the setTimeout API to make the page dynamic from page load.

## Carousel to show past projects and feature for Founders and Coders application.

This was a good challenge and although I was learning from a tutorial some things had to be changed in order to achieve a correct layout at first. I paused step by step to make sure I was clear with what the code meant and now I can create a carousel hen i need one! Superb.
