# Founders-and-coders-Website-project

## Website project built for application to the Founders & Coders pre-apprenticeship program.

The website tells the user a little about me as a developer and shows off some of the skills I have learnt so far. 

The site can be viewed here https://d0g3bl2.github.io/Founders-and-coders-Website-project/
